In this version the pop up for pro has a timer and a counter which works

Video pauses when pop up appears

Redirect message is different for pro.

We also have the search counter with warning messages and pop up


Added a block button on the counter/timer badge




Probably want to hard block after 15 mins of shorts anyway


Also probably want a global counter thats shows total time and then format becomes super minimla in fullscnree?



We have the counter but it disappears after reloads (e.g. the shorts reload - but the timer is right)


Time works nicely
Sorted global dev overlay and the clean exit



at some point add
Quick fix: Counter disappearing after reloads
Feature: Hard block after 15 mins of Shorts (if desired)
Readjsut limits etc
